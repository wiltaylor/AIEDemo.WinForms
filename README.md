# AIE Demo - WinForms
This repository contains an example WinForms application to demonstrate my ability to create WinForm applications for RPL purposes.

## Building
There are no extra steps to building this application. It should simply be a matter of building and running the application from Visual Studio.

## Installation
There is no installation package for this application. You can simply copy the resulting files created in the bin\Release or bin\Debug folder to a desired location and run it.

## Usage
Simply run AIEDemo.Winforms.exe from a folder you have write access to.

## Contribution
This was a one off example and it is not expected that anyone will want to contribute to it.
